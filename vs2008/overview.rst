|leptonlib| is a library of image processing routines written in C. This
document discusses :doc:`linking <building-other-programs>` with
:doc:`pre-built Windows 32-bit binaries <downloading-binaries>` to
create working executables with Microsoft's Visual Studio 2008. A brief
section on using :doc:`Visual Studio 2010 <vs2010-notes>` is also
included.

|leptonlib| can process a number of image file types. The supplied
static and dynamic libraries support the JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF file
formats.

Also :ref:`available <microsoft-visual-studio-download>` is a
:doc:`Visual Studio 2008 solution <vs2008-solution>` that lets you build
the :doc:`library <building-leptonlib>` and the :doc:`executables
<building-prog-dir>` in the Leptonica `/prog` directory. It contains a
complete hierarchy of all the `/prog` directory programs listed by type,
category, and filename to make browsing the many files easier.

Detailed :doc:`instructions <building-image-libraries>` are given on
rebuilding the supplied image libraries.
